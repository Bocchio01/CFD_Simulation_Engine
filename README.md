Lid-driven cavity incompressible flow solution

</div>

## Problem statement

The problem consists in a square cavity with a lid moving at a constant velocity.
The flow is incompressible and Reynolds number is low (Re <= 1000).
**Navier-Stokes** equations and the **pressure-velocity coupling** are used to solve the problem.

## Methods and schemes

The code is able to solve the problem using various methods and schemes.
In particular, we can choose the following options:

- Methods:
  - **Gauss-Siedel (SCGS)**
  - **SIMPLE** (not implemented yet)
- Schemes:
  - **Convection schemes**:
    - UDS
    - CDS
    - QUICK
    - Hybrid (not implemented yet)
  - **Diffusion schemes**:
    - Second order central difference
    - Fourth order central difference

## Data input

The code reads the input parameters from a file in JSON format.

```json

    "in": {
        "uLid": 1.0,
        "geometry": {
            "x": 1.0,
            "y": 1.0
        },
        "fluid": {
            "Re": 1000
        }
    },
    "engine": {
        "mesh": {
            "nodes": {
                "Nx": 80,

                "v": 0.08
            }
        },
        "schemes": {
            "convection": "QUICK",
            "diffusion": "SECOND"
        }
    }
}
```

### CMD input

From the command line, the possible input arguments are:

- `-h` or `--help` to print the help
- `-v` or `--version` to print the version
- `-i` or `--in` to specify the input file path (relative or absolute). Default: `-i simulations/input/input.json`
- `-f` or `--format` to specify the out file format. Default: `-f DAT`

## Output

The output is saved in a `DAT` file and it is possible to visualize it using the `MATLAB` script provided in the `simulations/plotting` folder.

An example of the output file is:

```bash
07_80_80_1000_QUICK_SECOND_008_008
RE=1000.000000

## How to...

### Clone/Download the repository

You can clone the repository either using git or downloading the zip file from the button `Code` on the top right of the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bocchio01/CFD_Simulation_Engine.git
```
<!--
### Clone/Download the executables

You can download the executables from the `releases` section of the repository.
The executables are provided for the following platforms:

- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS
-->

### Compile the source code

Given the relavitely complexity of the code, it is recommended to use the `CMake` build system to compile the code.
You can compile the code by typing the following command from the root folder of the repository:

```bash
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

### Run the code

If you have compiled the code using the `CMake` build system, you can run the code by typing the following command from the root folder of the repository:

```bash
./build/Debug/CFD_Simulation_Engine
```

Here is an example of how to run the code with the default parameters:

```bash
./build/Debug/CFD_Simulation_Engine -i simulations/input/input.json -f DAT
```

### Plot the results

You can plot the results using the `MATLAB` script provided in the `simulations/plotting` folder.
